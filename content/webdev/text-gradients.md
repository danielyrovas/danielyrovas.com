Using `color: transparent;`, `background-clip: text;` and setting the background to a gradient can produce quite a nice effect. However, using this as a hover effect causes text shift which is upsetting. It also can cause extensions like `dark reader` that shift the page's scheme to a dark mode, to blank out the text, and cause it to become invisible or unreadable.
