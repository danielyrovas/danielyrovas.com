## [LinkDing](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding/) is great
I've been happily bookmarking the entire internet with [LinkDing](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding/) for over two years now. It has served me quite well for archiving content and helping me reduce the number of tabs I have open (*waay too many*).

## No Android client
One major pain point in my usage of LinkDing has been the lack of a solid Android client that can save bookmarks and interesting articles when I come across them on mobile - *and often don't have time to read them right at that moment*.

I don't want my browster tab icon to become this: :infinity:

## [Linklater](https://github.com/danielyrovas/linklater)

Linklater is a simple app that provides exactly this functionality: save bookmarks using the Android share menu.

You can download it from the releases on GitHub [here :link:](https://github.com/danielyrovas/linklater/releases).

#### Note:

If you run into a Play Protect screen, you may need to click allow install from an unknown developer - I have not released an app to the Play Store and Play Protect does not recognise the signing key the app has been signed by.
