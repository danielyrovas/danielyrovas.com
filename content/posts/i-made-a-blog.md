## Building a personal website

> Starting things can be difficult. Maintaining things over the long term even more so.

I have gone through many iterations of this website, using different frameworks, themes and templates. I started with [WordPress](https://WordPress.com), but I didn't like using its admin panel, so I moved to [Zola](https://getzola.org) and then to a custom static site generator using a combination of [Zola](https://getzola.org), [Axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org).

I've recently moved to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) because I was impressed with the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) theme and I decided to migrate to it.

## Inspiration

I've stumbled across many blogs on my journey to writing my own, and I'm impressed with the variety of designs that I have come across. Moreover, I'm astounded at the amount of personal sites there are, and how fun so many of them look!

Anyway, here are a number of the sites that I've perused on my journey, most of them relate to programming or technology in some way:
