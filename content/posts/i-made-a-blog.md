As is typical with most people who begin a blog site in the land of technology, we must begin with a post describing our choice of tools and frameworks that we used to build the site. So, here is mine.

I've stumbled across many blogs on my journey to writing my own, and the one thing I've found that always impresses me, is a simple design. A lot of the inspiration for the initial design that I've ended up with, has come from Bennett's site, [bennett.dev](https://bennett.dev), and the Abridge Zola theme created by [Jake G](https://github.com/Jieiku).
